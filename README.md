# AI-Driven 3D Visualization of Urban Sustainability Metrics

This project creates an interactive 3D visualization of urban sustainability metrics, such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, and green space, using AI-driven predictions. It combines machine learning (Random Forest Regression) with advanced 3D visualization tools (Plotly) to showcase current and predicted sustainability trends. The project also includes a deployable web app using Dash for real-time interaction.

## Project Overview

Urban sustainability is a critical challenge in modern cities, requiring data-driven solutions to optimize resource usage and reduce environmental impact. This project leverages AI to predict and visualize sustainability metrics, enabling policymakers and urban planners to make informed decisions. By integrating machine learning with interactive 3D visualizations, it bridges the gap between data analysis and actionable insights.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suliman623/urban-sustainability-ai.git
   cd urban-sustainability-ai
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook (`Urban_Sustainability_AI.ipynb`) to explore the code and visualizations.

5. **Run the Dash app** (optional):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
