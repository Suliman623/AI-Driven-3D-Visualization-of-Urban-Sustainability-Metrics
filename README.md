# AI-Driven 3D Visualization of Urban Sustainability Metrics

This project creates an interactive 3D visualization of urban sustainability metrics, such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, and green space, using AI-driven predictions. It combines machine learning (Random Forest Regression) with advanced 3D visualization tools (Plotly) to showcase current and predicted sustainability trends. The project also includes a deployable web app using Dash for real-time interaction.
